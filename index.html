        <p> When you’re a web developer, a lot of your business growth depends on you getting out there and marketing it. 
            This means going to conventions and conferences, talking with other clints or customers and just spreading the word. 
            However, this also means you’re not only selling the service – you’re also selling you. 
            If you don’t have a personal brand to sell, you can’t expect prospects to be interested in what you’re offering. 
            Think of your personal brand like a gateway to your business. 
            When you connect with a potential customer or member of your industry, you can connect on a more personal level rather than jumping straight into marketing your brand. 
            This improves your relationships and helps you seem more credible. When you have that initial connection, you can then introduce your business without seeming pushy. 
            Your personal brand improves your work opportunities. </p>

        <h4> The quickest way </h4>

        <p> Social media branding is about consistently using the right methods to engage with your target audience on social media platforms. 
            The aim or purpose is to boost brand awareness. By leveraging the power of social media branding, you can build a robust network of fans. </p>
